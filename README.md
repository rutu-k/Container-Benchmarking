This repository contains steps to run benchmarking tools namely, LINPACK, STREAM and GUPS
to test Docker and LXC containers. The details of benchmarking tools are as follows:

1. LINPACK:
  The LINPACK Benchmarks are a measure of a system's floating point computing power. 
  they measure how fast a computer solves a dense n by n system of linear equations 
  Ax = b, which is a common task in engineering.

2. STREAM:
  The STREAM benchmark is a simple synthetic benchmark program that measures sustainable 
  memory bandwidth (in MB/s) and the corresponding computation rate for simple vector 
  kernels. 

3. GUPS-Giga Updates per Second (Random Access)
  GUPS is a measure of computer performance. GUPS is a measurement of how frequently a 
  computer can issue updates to randomly generated RAM locations. GUPS measurements 
  stress the latency and especially bandwidth capabilities of a machine.
